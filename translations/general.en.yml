  description: 'This dashboard is a personal project created to develop and showcase skills on tools for data science and web application, focusing on the analisys of buidings energy consumption. The energy data is updated directly through an [API](https://helsinki-openapi.nuuka.cloud/swagger/index.html#/) provided by Helsinki (Finland) municipality, and the weather data are extracted from the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/). The first set o charts show the historical data, as for the second combines weather forecast (also provided by Open Meteo) and energy consumption prediction, generated by a Machine Learning model. More details about this project implementation can be seen [here](https://github.com/brunoperdigao/Building-Energy-Dashboard).'
